Console Flashcards app

Built with Python using a cloud-hosted MySQL database

If you want to connect to a cloud database, create a .env file in the root directory with these variables:
* 'host'
* 'port'
* 'user'
* 'password'
* 'db'

If a .env file isn't found, you'll have the option of creating a local sqlite database
